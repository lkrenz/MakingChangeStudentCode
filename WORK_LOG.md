| January 27 | 1 Hr in class | I spent this time working with my group to come up with a solution to this problem set. The solution we landed on uses memoization to find the number of paths to each value you encounter while adding up coins. IE if you have 1 2 and 5 coins, after the first time you arrive at 3, you know there are 2 solutions to get there and you never have to check again. To solve the exponential memory issue, we will store the lowest coin thus far added to the array and never add a higher coin (in the case we are going down from the total). This will solve the issue of repeat cases, IE removing two then removing one and removing one then removing two to make three. |

I got a good amount of the way, but I didn't actually get the code finished enough to run.I will finish and debug in my next session. |

I finished the initial code and it passes all cases. In my next session I will implement tabulation. |
